Soccer Selector is a web application that is used to navigate through the top 5 soccer leagues in Europe to find information on individual teams. Users start on a page where they click through a carousel of league logo images to explore. Once a league is selected, the teams of that league populate on the field below and you can click on a team to generate a modal with that team's info. Th information is imported from a third party API.
